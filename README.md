# Evaluation-of-an-Object-Detector
Object detection is the process of localizing and classifying objects in an image or a video through computer vision. With the advent of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the dominant method for object detection. In this task, the Kitti dataset is used to train the complex YOLO model
